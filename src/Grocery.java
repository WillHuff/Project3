public class Grocery {
    double price;
    double units;
    double discount;

   /* 1) A constructor to assign values to price, units, discount and it has to call super
    class constructor to pass values to Super class constructor.
            2) computeDiscount(), which is declared in the Interface Discount
3) computeTax(), which is declared in Tax interface
4) double computeTotalPrice() to compute the final price for the item
5) A method displayGrocery() to display itemCode, name, unit price, units, savings,
    subtotal, tax amount, and final price for the item.
    Note: Here the discount and Tax are to be taken in percentage. The discount is optional,
    meaning you can buy an item without any discount at sometimes and with discount at
    other times. So, you pass 0 when there is no discount and you pass different
    percentages say 10 %, 20%, etc. at other times. */
